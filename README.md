# quid-wordpress
Wordpress Plugin

The html file will be on the frontend, wordpress has HTML widgets that you can place on the page.

We can use a shortcode to remove some of the JS from the user's side.
Using a shortcode they'd see something like [quid-init] and wordpress would render our code in it's place at runtime.
We can also pass in values such as [quid-init apiKey="kt-7387hhd7df3783hbd3" productID="awesome article name"].
