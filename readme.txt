## LET YOUR FANS SUPPORT YOU
QUID is kickstarting the pay-per-use economy by letting users make payments as low as 1¢ for articles, podcasts, and donations.

## QUID WORKS FOR BLOGGERS
*   Monetize your content with micropayments instead of ads.
*   Earn revenue for your work without resorting to subscription paywalls.
*   Give your fans a way to reward you for the content they love.

## QUID WORKS FOR YOU
*   QUID is at least 30% cheaper than other payment processors for transactions under a dollar.
*   The savings keep going up as the transaction sizes get smaller.
*   You really can charge money for the content you create, in addition to how you currently earn income!

## QUID WORKS FOR WORDPRESS
*   Enable QUID payments on only the posts you want and either require a payment or make it optional.
*   Choose to display a payment button with a price that you set for each post or display a slider that lets the user choose the amount to pay.
*   Automatically display content that has already been purchased by the user.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is QUID? =

QUID is a modern payment platform that lets you transact in pennies at very high volumes. It's designed to work with all kinds of currencies (fiat and crypto) and in all kinds of environments (Web, IoT, SaaS, etc.)

= Why do I need QUID? =

Accepting payments under a dollar today is extraordinarily expensive. Most payment providers charge a minimum of 30¢ + 3% per transaction, which comes out to a 30% premium (at least) on your product, and this is excluding the cost of monthly fees, chargebacks, and fraud prevention.

With QUID, you can actually charge a dollar, or 10 cents, or even a penny for your product, and relieve yourself from the hassle of complex (and unreliable) monetization schemes like ads, subscriptions, or arbitrarily bundled products.

= What countries are currently supported? =

QUID currently supports sellers in Canada, and buyers worldwide. We plan to expand to the US and other countries soon.

= What currencies does it support? =

QUID supports USD and CAD. We will add support for other currencies (including cryptocurrencies) soon.

= Are there restrictions on how QUID can be used? =

QUID is meant to be used for the purchase goods and services, not to transfer money between individuals or organizations. QUID also prohibits the selling or trading of counterfeit, dangerous, dishonest, or inappropriate goods, services or content. QUID also restricts the sale of alcohol, adult content, copyright-infringing content, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and gambling-related services on our platform. We reserve the right to reject or close accounts that are found to be trading in such goods and services.

== Screenshots ==

1. After installing and activating the QUID Payments plugin, navigate to the Settings > QUID Payments settings page and input your Public and Private API keys from your [QUID merchant account](https://app.quid.works/merchant). Your raw Private API key will not be saved in the database, only a hash of the key is saved.
2. Configure the QUID post settings fields for each post where you want to display the payment button or slider. For detailed instructions on how to use each field visit our [knowledge base](https://how.quid.works/about/quid-wordpress-plugin). Include an excerpt of the post for the plugin to display before a user has paid.
3. Once your post is published, the payment button or slider will be displayed below the excerpt of the post.
4. Upon clicking the Pay button the user is presented with a payment confirmation screen.
5. Once the payment succeeds, the full post content is displayed.
